# ReactStarterApp

This is a Starter app that I forked from [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) for my
specific needs.

This has a nice set of npm scripts and comes with the following things:

- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- Jest
- SCSS
- Babel (so you can use ES6)
- Bootstrap
- Hot reload

## Get Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

## Linting and Testing

You can execute the linter manually by running `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:watch`.

Similarly, you can run tests manually with `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`.
